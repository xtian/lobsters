    Pass Along an Invitation

  <p>
  This community can only grow when members invite new users, just as
  <strong><%= @user.invited_by_user&.username %></strong> invited you.
  Take a moment and invite someone you know.
  </p>

  <%= render partial: "users/invitationform",
    locals: { return_home: true } %>

  or

  <p>
  <%= button_to "Skip", "/", method: :get %>
